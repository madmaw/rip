IMPORTANT! The game will take about one minute to generate all the textures before starting. Just be patient.

Z/X - Rotate Camera (you will need this)
Left/Right - Move
Shift - Run/Turn
Up - Jump
Walk Backward + Up - Backstep
A/S - Light/Heavy Attack
D - Shove/Use/Drink
Down+D - Pick Up/Drop
Click to restart after death

Alternatively, you can decide how long you want to wait vs how good your graphics will be.

Made for JS13K in 2022. Specular lightly was added afterward since I couldn't get it to fit.
